# Implement-the-Shape-hierarchy-
Each Two-DimensionalShape should contain method getArea to calculate the area of the two-dimensionalshape. Each ThreeDimensionalShape should have methods getArea and getVolume to calculate thesurface area and volume, respectively, of the three-dimensional shape.I Created a program that usesan array of Shape references to objects of each concrete class in the hierarchy. The program would print a text description of the object to which each array element refers. Also, in the loop that pro-cesses all the shapes in the array,I determined whether each shape is a TwoDimensionalShape or aThreeDimensionalShape. If it’s a TwoDimensionalShape, display its area. If it’s a ThreeDimension-alShape, display its area and volume.
